# BushTripRelocator

This application saves and restores current aircraft position. Is created specifically for BushTrip mode in MSFS. Allows user to save location of aircraft at the end of leg in specific parking position. On leg start user can load last position and start leg from place where left. Intention was to bring back similar BushTrip behaviour from beginning of MSFS cycle. 

# Installation
Unzip archive to intended location and run BushTripRelocator.exe

# Usage
Application is very simple and easy to use. User can simply taxi to intended parking position and save location. Application displays number of saved checkpoints to chose for load. Is not storing full aircraft state. However user can chose to start with default state which is fully up and running or with cold and dark state. User also can save and  load quantity of fuel left from last leg and change time of the day.
